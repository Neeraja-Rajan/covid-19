<h2><i><b>How does COVID-19 spread?</b></i></h2>
<p>The virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated
through coughing and sneezing). Individuals can also be infected from and touching surfaces
contaminated with the virus and touching their face (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth). The COVID-19 virus may
survive on surfaces for several hours, but simple disinfectants can kill it.</p>
<h3><i><b>Who is?most at risk?</b></i></h3>
<p>We are learning more about how?covid-19?affects people every day.?Older people, and people with
chronic medical conditions,?such as diabetes and heart disease,?appear to be more at risk of developing
severe symptoms.? As this is a new virus, we are still learning about how it affects children. We know it is
possible for people of any age to be infected with the virus, but so far there are relatively few cases of
COVID-19 reported among children. This is a new virus and we need to learn more about how it affects
children. The virus can be fatal in rare cases, so far mainly among older people with pre-existing medical
conditions.</p>
<h4><i><b>What is the treatment for COVID-19?</b></i></h4>
<p>There is no currently available vaccine for COVID-19. However, many of the symptoms can be treated
and getting early care from a healthcare provider can make the disease less dangerous. There are
several clinical trials that are being conducted to evaluate potential therapeutics for COVID-19.</p>
<h5><i><b>How can the spread of COVID-19 be slowed down or prevented?</b></i></h5>
<p>As with other respiratory infections like the flu or the common cold, public health measures are critical to
slow the spread of illnesses. Public health measures are everyday preventive actions that include:</p>
<p>*staying home when sick.</p>
<p>* covering mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue when coughing or sneezing. Dispose of
used tissue immediately.</p>
<p>* washing hands often with soap and water.</p>
<p>* cleaning frequently touched surfaces and objects.</p>
<p>As we learn more about COVID-19 public health officials may recommend additional actions. </p>
<h6><i><b>Basic principles</b></i></h6>
<p>Following basic principles can help keep students, teachers, and staff safe at school and help stop the
spread of this disease. Recommendations for healthy schools are:</p>
<p>• Sick students, teachers and other staff should not come to school.</p>
<p>• Schools should enforce regular hand washing with safe water and soap, alcohol rub/hand
sanitizer or chlorine solution and, at a minimum, daily disinfection and cleaning of school
surfaces.</p>
<p>• Schools should provide water, sanitation and waste management facilities and follow
environmental cleaning and decontamination procedures.</p>
<p>• Schools should promote social distancing (a term applied to certain actions that are taken to
slow down the spread of a highly contagious disease, including limiting large groups of people
coming together).</p>
<h7><b><i>Know the latest facts</i></b></h7>
<p>Understand basic information about coronavirus disease (COVID-19), including its symptoms,
complications, how it is transmitted and how to prevent transmission. Stay informed about COVID-19
through reputable sources such as UNICEF, WHO and national health ministry advisories. Be aware
of fake information/myths that may circulate by word-of-mouth or online.
Ensure safe school operations.
Update or develop school emergency and contingency plans. Work with officials to guarantee schools
are not used as shelters, treatment units, etc. Consider cancelling any community events/meetings
that usually take place on school premises, based on risk.
Reinforce frequent handwashing and sanitation and procure needed supplies. Prepare and maintain
handwashing stations with soap and water, and if possible, place alcohol-based hand rub (hand
sanitizers) in each classroom, at entrances and exits, and near lunchrooms and toilets.
Clean and disinfect school buildings, classrooms and especially water and sanitation facilities at least
once a day, particularly surfaces that are touched by many people (railings, lunch tables, sports
equipment, door and window handles, toys, teaching and learning aids etc.)</p>
<p>Implement social distancing practices that may include:</p>
<p>• Staggering the beginning and end of the school day.</p>
<p>• Cancelling assemblies, sports games and other events that create crowded conditions.</p>
<p>• When possible, create space for children’s desks to be at least one metre apart.</p>
<p>• Teach and model creating space and avoiding unnecessary touching.
